Just a place to put a few 3D Printing STL files



I should put these on thingiverse, but that is for another day. I just want a place where it is easy to update with new files as I decide I don't like the old files.



note: .stl files you can dowwnload and use on any 3D printer and most 3D software can import .stl files however a few tricks help reduce the number of verticies. (x-limited dissolve and the modifier decimate in blender)


The .blend fi8les can be loaded directly into blender, activate the add-on (mesh) 3D Print Tools, then when the file is manifold you can export it as a .stl file.
